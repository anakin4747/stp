So the program will require you to input several switches with their priority
and MAC address. And each connection the switch has as well as information that
is needed to determine the cost of the link.


    Input:
        Name of switch : char[MAX]
        Priority, MAC Address -> Bridge ID : char*, char* -> long long 64 bit
        Connection :
            - Connects to which switch name 
            - Cost of link
    

    The program will need to process the input to check valid MAC addresses and
    priority. Not much name validation will be done not really necessary just
    enforce a max length. All the links need to match.


    input.c
        - processes command line args to return the switch topology.
        
    switch.c
        - class which defines a switch object


So you are going to use ncurses to make a menu for inputting everything.

COOL: Spawn a thread that processes the input to predict or validate input

    You will iterate over switches to implement 

Example prompt:

Switch 1:
    Name =  (Gets saved for autocomplete in later switch definitions)
    Priority =      (No input sets default as 32768)
    MAC Address =   (Accepts all 3 forms of MAC address input)

    Links:
        Opposite Node =  (For later switches I want a way to provide a
                            autocompelete for this option)
        Link Speed =  (Look into specs for typical inputs)

Another example prompt:

Switch 1 : Name     (This switch has already been defined)

Switch 2:
    Name =  
    Priority =      
    MAC Address =   

    Links:
        Opposite Node =  
        Link Speed =  

So for commands I want to incorporate some vim like key bindings

After the first switch the second one should be auto filled with all the same
info as the first. Then the user should be able to change the default with c,
select the input with <enter>, edit the input with a, i, A, I. <esc> exits
editting and enter moves to the next input in either mode. You can use the hjkl
to move between options. If you move up back to the previous switch you start
to edit that one and the current one closes.

Building a loop free topology.

Since Layer 2 doesn't have the TTL which decrements every hop like routers do
in Layer 3, we need to ensure looping does not occur but also that we have
redundancy.

Steps:

    Step 1: Who is the root bridge?

        The root bridge is determined by the ethernet switch with the lowest
        bridge ID. The bridge ID is determined by the priority which can be
        altered and the MAC address. Default priority is 32768.

            Priority (2 Bytes) + MAC Address (6 Bytes) = Bridge ID (8 Bytes)

        The lowest bridge ID is the root bridge by default.

    Step 2: What are the root ports?

        The root ports are the path back to the root bridge with the lowest
        cost. So each switch has one except for the root bridge.

            Port Costs: (Long Path Cost Method)

                Port Speed          STP Port Cost
                  10 Mbps            2 000 000
                 100 Mbps              200 000
                   1 Gbps               20 000
                  10 Gbps                2 000

                    SW1(RB)
                    /     \
                  /         \
                /             \
            RP/                 \RP
            SW2-----------------SW3

        The links above switches 2 and 3 point back to the root bridge. The
        ports which point are Root Ports.

    Step 3: What are the designated ports?

        The designated ports are closest port to the root bridge on each
        segment. The root bridge's ports included.
                    
                    SW1(RB)
                  DP/     \DP
                  /         \
                /             \
            RP/                 \RP
            SW2-----------------SW3

        We can first choose the ports on the root bridge to be designated ports.

        But then we need to determine the designated port on the bottom segment.
        To determine the designated port by calculating the cost of the closest
        port. Let's say that each segment share a port cost of 4. That means
        the ports on the connection between SW2 and SW3 both have the some cost
        of 8 from data coming from the RB through the opposing switch.

        Its a tie so we choose the lowest bridge ID. Let's say switch 2 has the lowest.

                    SW1(RB)
                  DP/     \DP
                  /         \
                /             \
            RP/                 \RP
            SW2-----------------SW3
               DP            BLK

        So we label the SW2 port as a DP and label any remaining ports as
        blocking ports.
